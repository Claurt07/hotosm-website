Jess provides support to HOT field programs around the world for training, GIS, and managing field operations. She has worked on the ground in Liberia, Tanzania, Uganda, Botswana, and Guatemala, as well as supporting other projects remotely.

Prior to working with HOT, Jess worked in academic research, government, and NGO settings to improve relations between marginalized communities and government agencies over environmental and land use issues, largely through the use of participatory mapping.
