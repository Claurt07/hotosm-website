Pete has a long history with HOT - launching and running the Missing Maps project (at MSF), as an active member of the Missing Maps London community and, finally, as a board member for three years. Pete worked at MSF for eleven years, starting as the first digital manager and finishing as the research and innovation team lead in a medical department. He has a pet hate for acronyms and initializations and loves playing geoguessr.
