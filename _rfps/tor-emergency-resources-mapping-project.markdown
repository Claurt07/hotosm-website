The Latin America and Caribbean Open Mapping Hub, supported by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, is inviting proposals for the Emergency Resources Mapping Project.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

The Emergency Resources Mapping project will be conducted in partnership with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA). CDEMA is the coordination agency for disaster management in the Caribbean region and has a membership of 19 states.  In 2023, HOT signed an MOU with CDEMA that promotes a mutually beneficial relationship between the two organizations.  

As part of HOT’s effort to cement itself in the Caribbean, it has been recognized that regional and local partnerships that encourage education on HOT’s contribution to DRR/DRM are critical.  This project aims to leverage the partnership of CDEMA and other organizations to train relevant stakeholders on DRR and the use of open data and open mapping for anticipatory action and emergency response.  To this end, this project will first be piloted in Belize in conjunction with the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO). 

The primary outcome of this project is to develop a comprehensive map/database of the emergency resources in Belize’s two cities and two towns. This will be presented to the relevant stakeholders to increase their awareness of the resources available in-country while also highlighting gaps and needs.

## OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES

* To increase the country’s resilience against different types of hazards through open data and open mapping solutions. 
* To develop a comprehensive map/database of selected emergency resources within Belize.
* To increase the availability of updated and accurate open-source data to Belize’s decision makers and public to facilitate informed decision-making in emergencies.
* To increase the NEMO’s and other stakeholders capacity to use open source data in emergencies. 
* To increase the public awareness of available emergency resources.
* To create/strengthen the open mapping and open data culture in Belize.
* To build partnerships between HOT and humanitarian/emergency response actors in Belize.
