Saint Lucia, like many Caribbean islands, is at risk of recurring hurricanes, tropical cyclones, landslides and flooding. The majority of the population  is clustered in the low land located near the coastal areas, leaving them exposed to the effects of these threats.  

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is  supporting the National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) and the national Central Statistics Office (CSO)  with their immediate needs. This includes providing base layer information on existing structures in target areas and capturing the required details required for the assessment needs of these agencies. An added result of the exercise will be  a pilot for establishing  and growing anOpenStreetMap community of mappers, which is lacking in most of the islands in this region. The community-focused approach involves training and field exercises  for long term impact throughout the island nation.
